      <description>Hello World! - March 22, 2020 My life has come to this I guess; scrolling through Zoom/quarantine memes, watching Michael Reeves scream at his microwave, and yelling at my own laptop wondering why it won&amp;rsquo;t render my code.
These past two weeks have been a double-edged sword for me. While classes and finals were cancelled, all Los Angeles/Orange County gyms are shut down and a long-planned, out-of-state, vacation is down the drain.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my site!
I&amp;rsquo;m a 21 year-old tech enthusiast and senior at UCI, where I am pursuing a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Software Engineering. While this site is primarily a utility for me to learn about DevOps culture and toolsets, I&amp;rsquo;ll make occasional posts about lifting, learning, coding, working, and other things I do to keep myself busy.
In my free time, I love listening to different genres of music, reading, browsing Reddit, and hiting the gym.</description>
